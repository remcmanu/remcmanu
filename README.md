👋 Hi, I’m Rob. I graduated from the **University at Buffalo** in December of 2022.

👀 I’m interested in computers throughout all their levels of abstraction. I like experimenting with microcontrollers, operating systems, programming languages, and software development.

🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis, trying to get better with Pandas.
<!--- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects. --->
